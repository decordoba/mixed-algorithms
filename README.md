# Mixed Algorithms
Some of the coding challenges and problems I faced in different places, solved in Python.

Here I will add all the algorithms that I find interesting that I had to solve from interviews, HackerRank, class, or any other place.
I think they may be useful in the future.

All of them will run without any change (they have a default input to demonstrate how the algorithm works, and most of them accept a different input through command line or from a file), and some of them even show a graphical representation of the problem using matplotlib, that will be (obviously) different depending on the input.
